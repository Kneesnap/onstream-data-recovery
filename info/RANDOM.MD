# Random Trivia
This document contains miscellaneous things I've learned which may not be helpful to you, but should probably be documented.  

These drives appear to have been called "DIGAMAX" drives before their official release.  

**Misc Notes:**  
```
 - track widths of 37.5 μm
 - combination with a minimum bit length of 0.35 μm enables at least 13 GB of user capacity on 1000 ft of 8 mm wide 900 Oe (∼72 kA/m)

 - The head to tape speed was held at 3.08 m/s and the results, without any normalisation
 - "The Eagle cartridges used by the new system contain 300 metres of 8-millimetre video tape “embossed” with a low-frequency guide signal deep in its magnetic coating."
 - "This keeps the recording heads aligned with the tape to an accuracy of 1 micrometre"
 - "This precision is vital because data is recorded over the guide signal in very narrow, parallel tracks. Eight tracks are recorded simultaneously across the width of the tape."
 - Oe seems to be 900Oe, Co-γFe2O3 This matches Travan TR-4.
