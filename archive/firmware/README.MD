# OnStream Firmware
These are the programs used to flash firmware onto the drives.  
Many of these contain current or outdated versions of the firmware inside of the executable.

**Notes:**  
 - I have no idea what "DSC support" is for Bus_5DK5.bin  
 - All of the firmware versions here are present in this repository, but some are inside of the flashing program executables.  
 - Most likely you do not need to flash any new firmware, these drives should work without.
